I tested the server code using the basic curl and Postman. I created a request for each of our endpoints in Postman
which ensure that every endpoints works correctly. 

With REST, each request made to a RESTful API contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and
process it. It is indepentent of any prior requests. The statelessness helps reduce complexity and improves scalablilty.
Following the REST principles, the client and server are loosely coupled. This separation ensures that changes on the
server-side do not directly addect the client.
RESTful APIs use standard HTTP status codes, which provide a clear indication of the result of the request.
This makes the application more robust by allowing clients to handle errors appropriately
