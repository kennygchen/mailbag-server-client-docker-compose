AJAX helps improve user experience in a web application. It enables parts of a web page to update dynamically without requiring a full page reload.
This make the web application a smoother and more interactive experience for users.
This also creates a faster response times by fetching data asynchronously. 
It reduces the time users spend waiting for page loads.
It also reduces server load. Instead of reloading the entire page, AJAX requests only the necessary data, 
reducing bandwidth consumption and server processing overhead.
